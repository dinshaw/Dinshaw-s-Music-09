    <meta name="keywords" content="One Milion Ways, Haulage Satan's missed again
          My fingers start to fly from the puddles I been lieing in,
          My heart feel warm each time my elbow bends.
          
          Sitting by the pool and playing slowly after dark,
          Maybe every star can here the words I sing.
          Hesitation /  Imagination  always been a feeling I could trust.
          You’ll never know the freedom of my rush.
          
          Left legs leaning hard upon the gas pump.
          Cigarette is working hard ,
          Said burring in my hand.
          I’m tired of being scared of things I have not done yet,
          No more waiting now I’m gonna bury everyone I can.
          
          Chorus-
          There are so many places that I have not been,
          And there are so many faces that I have not seen
          There are so many feelings I have left to find.
          There are so many ways that I could die
          I've got one million ways to die
          
          A man in his last sweat broke from the scean,
          He said I wish I had taken my time with this one.
          Around him lay pieces of various dreams.
          Dead at there first sight of light of the sun.
          Where has the thrill gone?
          I’m starting to see,
          Its’s as easy to die when your 19 or 103.
          
          Healer please I’ve come from death through Satan's great door,
          I have walked the earth in hunger and in vein
          I’ve come to kill the rumors that I will not rise,
          And I am not going back with out a name.
          But the higher burns the fire, the wider spreads the light.
          And conscience has captured me tonight.
          
          I have owned A good man and his name,
          Had a princess between royal sheets seemed more or less the same.
          I’ve cheated death in every way so far that I can find,
          But I’m still wanting,
          Woln’t you tell me why?
          Because freedom,
          Can only be kept in mind.
